    <p>This exercise is about making lists </p>
       <p> Here's what I like about lists:</p>
       <li>They're useful for displaying lists of stuff</li>
       <li>That's about it</li>
       <li>I'm gunna put another list item here because doing things in threes is cool</li>
    <p>When you make a list, do it in this order:</p>   
    <ol>1. Decide if it's an ordered list or not</ol>
    <ol>2. If it's not an ordered list, use the ul tag, otherwise use the old</ol>
       <!-- <li> Use li tags nested in the list for your list items</li> -->
        <ol>1. Curveball! You can nest lists inside each other</ol>
<ol>3. You've got this, I believe in you!</ol>
